# I'm Bryan Fonseca, an Ecuadorian Software Engineer. #
## About me ##

As I said I'm from Ecuador which means I speak Spanish mainly.
I like data structures and solving problems using the most efficient solutions.

I'm currently focused on Web Development (frontend) but I have experience working with C# and Python.
I'm also into game development using Unity (C#) and hmu if you need some help.

Currently and permanently learning.
